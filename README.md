# A simple project to automate annoying stuff
###### At least the ones that are about battery powered led strips
## Requirements to flash to esp32:
Make sure you install this library and board:

(you don't need the older board version, I'm pretty sure the newest one will work too)
## Stuff to change before flashing:
rename "config.demo.h" to "config.h", and change the values within based on your needs
## Wiring, slightly annoying but a neccesity:
In my case, my led's take in 5V but the esp32 outputs 3.3V, so I'll use an "IRLZ44N N-MOSFET"

based on the diagram provided above, we need to wire it up like this:
5V power source > ESP32 5V and led's positive terminal
MOSFET Gate > 1kÎ© resistor > ESP32's pwm pin of your choice
MOSFET Source > Ground shared with ESP32
MOSFET Drain > led's negative terminal
## Home Assistant configuration:
You'll need the "Mosquitto broker" addon, and set up a login in it's configuration, it'll allow the esp32 and HA to communicate together
I have not figured out the discovery devices so you'll need to paste the HA config from "configuration.demo.h"
For the light card... it's in the same place as the HA config
