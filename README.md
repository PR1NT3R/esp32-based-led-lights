# A simple project to automate annoying stuff
###### At least the ones that are about battery powered led strips
## Requirements to flash to esp32:
Make sure you install this library and board:

(you don't need the older board version, I'm pretty sure the newest one will work too)
## Stuff to change before flashing:
rename "config.demo.h" to "config.h", and change the values within based on your needs
